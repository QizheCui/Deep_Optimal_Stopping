# Part2

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Part2 of the Simulation Methods for Finance coursework.

This project has the following structure:
- `DOS.py`: This file contains the implementation for the Deep Optimal Stopping method include path simulation, neural network initialization, training etc.
- `DOS_1D.ipynb`,`DOS_2D.ipynb`,`DOS_5D.ipynb`,`DOS_10D.ipynb`: They are examples of pricing Bermudan Max-Call Option with the DOS method for different dimension $D$.
- `DOS_Advanced.ipynb`: A simple extension to the original paper using more complex network architecture.
- `Longstaff_Schwartz.ipynb`: The file contain implementation of the Longstaff-Schwartz method, then use it to price the Bermudan Max-Call Option in different dimension.
